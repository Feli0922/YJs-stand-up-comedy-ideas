<p>I’m so confused about what I wanted to do. For one moment, I convinced myself to be a coder. For another, I thought about trying to be a lawyer. And why’s that? Someone in 康村2024新生群 posted a question about “Any 学长学姐” gonna take PSYCH Psychology and Law? I looked up Language and the Law as well as Memory and the Law. I thought about the TV series Suits, and I’m like, heck yeah!</p>
<p>It’s a weird time, you know, when Trump made a futile attempt to “ban” WeChat, I was so rebellious: there’s no way you can ban wechat, I’m gonna come up with an alternative! I’m gonna figure out the reverse-VPN thing! Screw you, CIA or whatever!</p>
<p>I don’t know what gives me that confidence. Maybe Felicity Smoak. Come to think of it, I’m the type that would 代入角色. So in the Arrow, I’m, certainly not the Arrow, nor the Assassin, you know, the physical type. And then there’s Felicity, and you know the rest. Maybe my heart broke a little after she’s together with the Arrow.</p>
<p>Anyway, after I cut my hair, my mom called out on me as a tomboy, which, when directly translated from Chinese, is “fake little boy”. Heck no! I want to be a “real big man”!</p>
